# AWS CFn examples with localstack
The aws-cloudformation-lesson repository covers examples of CloudFormation templates.

Do you like AWS CloudFormation? I'm not a fan and I dislike it. However, when building infrastructure as code (IaC) on AWS, using CFn is inevitable (although there are other options like CDK and Terraform).

So, I'll have ChatGPT create questions, and I'll provide the answer to that problem. Building infrastructure on AWS incurs costs. So, I will use [localstack (AWS mock)](https://localstack.cloud/). However, please note that there is a monthly fee for using localstack to mock certain AWS services.

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [localstack](https://localstack.cloud/)

## Questions & Answers
[WIP]

## Contributing
I'm looking for someone who can come up with the infrastructure construction (it means 'question') that should be created with CloudFormation.  

Contributions are not only related to development. For example, GitHub Star motivates me to develop!

## Special Thanks
![localstack](./docs/images/localstack-readme-banner.svg)
[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/) is a service that mocks AWS, covering a wide range of AWS services. It is not easy to set up an AWS infrastructure for personal development, but LocalStack has lowered the barrier for server application development.   

It has been incredibly helpful for my technical learning, and among the open-source software (OSS) I encountered in 2023, LocalStack is undoubtedly the best tool. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude.
